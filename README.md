# My-Camps

Hi. Welcome to MyCamps README file.

MyCamps is a full-stack CRUD web application that serves to provide users with campgrounds within their proximity. Users can also add campgrounds to help other users find easily.

Users are able to register, login, logout, make a post, with or without a photo accompanying the post. Users are also able to make comments and replies anonymously under a campground post.

MyCamps uses Cloudinary to save photos in cloud and also heroku is the hosting platform.
